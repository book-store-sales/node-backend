Book Condition: Fine, interior like new; slight shelf wear to exterior spine. 35pp. Illustrated throughout. (ill. in colour &amp; b/w).A definitive, guerilla zine anthology of everything Sex Pistols edited, photographed, and designed by Ray Stevenson. The facsimile collage is a textural element that formally compliments the perception of wildness in the actual image and texts. Stevenson has layered newspaper clipping, show still, and photos of the slouchers, posed and unposed, in colour and black and white. The kind of mosaic of the Pistols ephemera spread is captioned by Stevenson's chronology and biography, personal critical commentary, and concrete poetry, adding a kind of mad structure to the composition absolutely in line with being out-of-line, like the Pistols themselves.

Jacket Condition: Fine, very slight signs of shelf wear at edges. 224pp. 250 illustration. (ill. in b/w) This volume is the first to rescue the study of women's influence in architecture from the domestic to the design. Led by an intent and culturally aware introduction, the volume is structured according to sections that determine a women's place in domesticity, architectural history, criticism, contemporary women architects, and the idea of spatial symbolism. Framing and following these subjects are a slew of almost relentless illustrations: sketches, blueprints, and photographs from all angles of the womans architectural progress take up more space than the texts––the pictures have as much say as any essay. The research and creation of this book was made possible as a publication and exhibition organized by The Architectural League of New York's  Archive of Women in Architecture.

Victor Lange).Three of the most influential of Goethe's extensive body of work, of which this volume is a part. Most famous to literature and melancholy is  The Sorrows of Young Wether , the moody and impossible story of inaction and desire, a kind of discursive masochism of the idea of love. So tortured was this character and his tragic tale, the book inspired an alarming spurt of suicides at the time of its first publication. Literature and criticism ate up Goethe's outcast complex and textual representation of self-abasement, emotional outbursts, and foreclosed desire's stuttering momentum. The book is found by Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and serves as source material for critics like Roland Barthes and Maggie Nelson. This volume is the definitive collection to become familiar with Goethe, and the character that persists as a symbol and theme in all Goethe's works, as well as literature and art today.

Jacket Condition: Fine, slightest signs of shelf wear. 282pp. French and EnglishThe care and consideration that went into this complete collection of Mallarmé's poetry can be felt throughout, from the introduction by translator Henry Weinfeild to the fit of the lithe serif font on the page. The poetry and prose poems breathe, the symbolist image sigh themselves from sign to sign. And the experimental, broken poems of free verse gasp across the page, making a symbol of language and an experience of reading that troubles itself into a new relationship between poetry and the text––one that would be in the unconscious of writing in the next century. Concrete poetry and graphic design were born of the rules Mallarmé broke into a new idea of a poetics, a simultaneously movable and mutable text. Each poem is printed in French and English and is followed by allegorical and discerning analysis by Weinfield. No Mallarmé is missing from this book. The volume is a monolith of literary history, at the exact edge of language before the 20th century would have its way with it.Trans. and w. commentary by Henry Weinfield.Jacket illustration:   Robert Garrison,  la vache enragé ",

The exhibition is a kind of index, built on the conceptual and physical bases that determine what work is, looks like, and feigns a primitive quality.

Nonetheless, Franks imbues his careful study of this molecular disinformation campaign with analysis of the material itself, the mentality of the 1970's science community, and asides that discuss the importance and science of our actual water, incredible all by itself.",

Rhapsody  is as numinous as it is numerous, a visual event that unfolds and refolds in real time, real space, and above all, real thought. Bartlett's grid-backed, colorful abstraction is driven by an implicit effort to explain itself: we don't see so much as watch the work, reading between the lines, learning endlessness also means labour, (mis-)translation, and a sense of an ending. <i>Rhapsody</i> was Bartlett's final exhibition, rigorously immortalized on the page: over 600 colour plates, a full exhibition history, and thorough work descriptions professionally catalogue the powerful series as much as Smith's introduction conceptualizes it, determining  Rhapsody  as something to think about as much as look at.

The compilation comes from a project intended to introduce foreign voices into the English poetry scene, as well as to highlight the art of translation itself. Poets across the board, including Elizabeth Bishop, Kenneth Rexroth, W.S. Merwin, Louise Levertove, etc. are animated by the symbols and sounds of a text that, before looking further, are already being interpreted as parts of a poem. Listening to or looking at poetry in another language reminds the poet of the outlines like sound and shape that are the bodies of poetry, and that in translation, become a doorway to enter into further understanding. With each poem printed alongside their originals, the variety of techniques and interpretations of the task in this volume is a fascinating and almost intimate kind poetic project for the readers themselves.

(ill. in colour &amp; b/w).A secluded little collection of pages, somewhere between print art, philosophy, and poems. Bill Bissett closes his chapbook between an illustrated card cover and black end pages that engulf the slideshow of his experimental poems. On little multi-coloured, handmade pages, Bissett turns phrases and symbols into little hand-pressed, letter-less words. With restraint and attention to space, Bissett's rearrangements and dismantled phrases reveal how much we rely on our language symbols to make sense, daring us to let down our associations and let imagination fill in the blanks.Signed with original illustration by the author.",

This slew of text is loosely organized into personal writings, interviews, conversations, proposals, and beautiful facsimiles of his notebook illustrations and notes in bit and pages. Published together, the various texts begin to form a discursive character of Ruscha that is both cheeky and earnest–who, despite all this material, leaves one always wanting to know more.Ed. and with an introduction by Alexandra Schwartz.Includes bibliographical references and index.An 'OCTOBER' book.",

A seminal figure in the Bauhaus art movement and founder of the Chicago School of Design in 1939, Haus goes deeper than biography in this monograph of Nagy's accomplishments and revelations. Haus looks at Nagy's innovations and conceptual impulses (the camera-less photogram, the role of painter who raised photography to the status of art) for the inner urgency Nagy left us with, a new way of critically interacting with the culture of aesthetics and art.

The introduction makes it plain: Who better to write about Yves Klein that Klein himself?

Newhall's introduction follows the life of Weston's work by marking points along the line of his shifting point of view, both as an artist and in his personal and professional life. What remains consistent is whatever can be captured starkly–the inherent contrasts of black and white, the depth and distances of landscape, turning objects and places into outlines of dark and light. Looking beyond the content of his collected works, the monograph acknowledges the artist's commitment to the rituals of serious printing and the darkroom, and addresses the future adventures and countries the artist planned to explore––new places to command for new forms.

This relic from the seventies is a totally earnest, super informative, almost innocent catalog of eye candy and euphemisms is the definitive beauty guide for men. Columnist Christopher Hix has compiled an anthology of men's tips and tricks (and illustrated examples) for the man actively in search of the look, filled with recommendations for a sensible self-care program based on logic and good clean fun. The hair salon magazine-sized handbook is divided into Hair, Face, The Body, &amp; Hands and Feet. The subsections have their own unique range. But one gets the feeling that even if Hix's guide has actual merit, it wouldn't be much without Bruce Weber's subversive, erotic, and totally fun photographs. Bearded men with dogs looking handsome, clean-cut blue-eyed boys, the man giving an enthusiastic example of how to lather up–for Weber's first publication of his work in print, he made it clear that he had an eye for what's looking good.Photographs by Bruce Weber.

She is a symbolic and allusive device: a way into the text, which Charles Williams boldly takes in The Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante. Taking the Beatrice figure as the subject of his study, he is able to remain specific–he separates his essay into the themes and narratives that frame her reference in Dante's successive poems. Following this chronological structure, his line of inquiry establishes itself, enough that he can trouble the text with the metaphysical and psychological questions that, perhaps in turn, resembles Dante's Beatrice, at the edge of the line he has to trouble on his own.",

Jacket Condition: Fine, slight markings on back cover. 91pp. 27 plates w. photo reproductions (ill. in colour &amp; b/w).From Thomas Hess, a critic and the editor of  Art News  magazine, is the first thorough monograph dedicated to Barnett Newman. Newman was a major influence to the artists that came after him, who followed the path he opened into color fields, the stripe, and encounters with an un-figured, monumental canvas. In this publication, Hess takes us through a rigorous timeline and analysis of Newman's life and work, presenting both biography and art history in the same sentence. Thorough and intimate, the text is framed by black &amp; white photos of Newman throughout his life, along with vibrant plates of his works. It is interesting: Newman's opinion is that his art represents a way of freeing ourselves from memory, association, nostalgia, myth...the image[s] [I] produce [are] the self-evident one[s] of revelation. Well, Hess takes all the things Newman doesn't believe in, and presents a dimensional representation that doesn't lack in revelation, of Newman as a person, a painter, and a critical point in art history.
